        p Isaac Asimov
  p It is in the same spirit as that of Isaac Asimov that I want to show my process of learning.
  p My interests have slowly taken me towards Computer Science and it is here that I will focus
    |  most of my efforts.
  p My curiosity has also pushed me towards Bitcoin as I believe it has a great potential and
    |  great value towards the betterment of our privacy and freedom.
  p For those who have an open mind and enjoy a good read on a wide range of topics regarding nature,
    |  I have a section dedicated exclusively to it so please check it out!
