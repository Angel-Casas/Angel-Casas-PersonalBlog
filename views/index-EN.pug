    p Self-education is, I firmly believe, the only kind of education there is.
    cite Isaac Asimov
  div#intro-message
    p It is in the same spirit as that of Isaac Asimov that I want to show my process of learning, 
      | which is why writting a blog seems to me like the most rewarding experience in terms of learning the topic at hand 
      | as well as allowing for anybody to not only learn with me but also to influence and correct any mistakes I may blindly fall into.
    p My interests have slowly taken me towards Computer Science and it is here where I will focus
      |  most of my efforts to provide a better understanding about this science, not only for me but also for anybody who happens to find my articles.
    p Some of these interests also include the study of economics, which I believe is a fundamental pilar for any society, and the study of mathematics which 
      |  helps me to have a deeper understanding of our world.
    p Below her silver creeks, behind her ephemeral clouds, between her streams of light in a forest, I hear the call of nature; follow me as I uncover her secrets and misteries.
    p Books show us how ignorant we where before we opened their covers, so in an effort to open up as many minds and elevate as many spirits as I can, I keep a section dedicated to them with
      |  a few lines to summarise it's value and a personal, subjective comment on why it deserves your attention.
