  <span class="color left">S</span>ome years ago, while I was still a teenager, a good friend of mine told me a decievingly simple phrase yet for some reason it struck
  me as extremely powerful and has remained in my mind ever since, which is why I wanted to share it so as to serve as an introduction towards the core idea of this article.
  So, here is what he said, reinterpreted in my own words:
</p>
<blockquote class='border-left'>
  <p>
    <i>
      I trust more a man who has learned from all religions and comes to a conclusion by his own than a man who just stays with the religion he first encountered.
    </i>
  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
  In order to understand why it struck me as powerful, I want to present you a simple analogy to describe the process our minds use to understand our surroundings. Imagine your mind as a source of
  light and the world around you as a mysterious figure veiled by darkness. How would you reveal the properties of the world? With our internal guide. If you focus your attention on a certain part of the world,
  you are shining this light towards it and can thereby gain knowledge of the thing observed, disposing it from it's veil of darkness. By repeating this process you can gain a higher understanding about our
  world and gradually shrink the darkness surrounding you. Now, reread the phrase above with this analogy in mind and you may understand why I still percieve it as a phrase with an extremely powerful
  meaning hidden behind it.
</p>
<p>
  It is that curiosity and that search for meaning which forms the basis of science and understanding, if we understand this we can also understand that holding onto an idea because many people believe in it doesn't
  make it real in any sense and only stops you from inquiring and finding the truth behind it, which is at the core of what science is.
</p>
<p>
  Having said this, I have been studying the science behind climate change for a while since there is a lot of misunderstandings and false claims circulating around the news media recently.
  Hopefully I can help push some clarity into the minds of those who blindly accept ill-informed judgments and try to encourage even just a few into investigating for themselves about this complex and
  extraordinary world we live in.
</p>
<p>
  If you don't have time to read this article completely here are the two important messages I tried to convey throughout this article:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    In order to be able to understand any kind of problem we face we must be able to discard every one of our prejudices and preconcieved ideas, for otherwise we would be trying to understand a problem,
    which <b>is always new</b>, throught the lens of our old understanding; something which renders impossible any attempt at finding a solution because <b>only a mind free from all its baggage can observe
    a problem in all its fullness</b>, being precisely from this observation from where the solution will arise. If we understand this, which is of vital importance, we can use science as a tool to scrutinise
    the innermost misteries of nature.
  </li>
  <li>
    Innovation and an increase in the level of wellbeing of the citizens should be a priority, for there is enough statistical evidence to show that the societies which value the individual and the free market have
    an increased sense of care for the world around them, which in return allows for novel ideas to tackle the effects of man-made changes in the climate.
  </li>
</ul>
<section id="sub-header-1">
  <h4 class="color">Key Questions</h4>
  <p>I structured this article in four distinct sections with the intent to facilitate a more paused reading in order to prevent this from becoming a burdensome article; the first utilizes an analogy about religion to evaluate current misunderstandings around climate change; the second one introduces the
    <b>Scientific Method</b> as a form of light in the darkness to fight against incorrect views; the third presents a series of facts about climate change many scientist try to hide and also
    tries to give a holistic view about our climate and our effects on it; the last part revolves around our current standpoint and as a closure I dedicate a few lines to talk about our possible future.
  </p>
  <p>
    These are the three questions I plan to answer by the end of this article, so if you feel they catch your curiosity please stay and follow me through my thought process and hopefully we
    can both reach a bit more clarity on this issues:
  </p>
  <ul class='numeral-list'>
    <li class="numeral">Why do people blindly accept information without checking it's real value, which happens to be the <i>leitmotif</i> of many religions?</li>
    <li class="numeral">Is climate change a real issue or simply a fact about an everchanging world?</li>
    <li class="numeral">Can we produce a change through a political position or is the individual the only valuable component of change?</li>
  </ul>

    Religion has been the cornerstone of most if not all major civilizations, for ever since we abandoned the caves we have been in search of an explanation about our presence in the universe.
    The latest evidence of ritual sites in <a href="https://www.smithsonianmag.com/history/gobekli-tepe-the-worlds-first-temple-83613665/">Gobekli Tepe</a>, estimated to be 11,000 years old, shows
    how human beings have been viewing the universe from a religious perspective in order to navigate their way through the darkness of our ignorance all the way up to our present days, where science has
    appeared as a substitute for the increasingly dogmatic views religions have taken. Although religions, or spiritual traditions more specifically, have been of vital importance in the construction of
    the greatest civilizations, it is its dogma that is causing its demise and the unprecedented rejection by an increasing number of populations across the globe, especially in western developed societies,
    in favor of a more atheistic view of the world.
    This does not mean we should reject everything about religion and blindly toss it away; we could abandon our presuposition that religion has nothing to say about reality and instead start uncovering
    the hidden truths spiritual traditions cherished so much, bringing in the scientific mindset and removing the dogmatic aspects which only serve to blur the distinction between true insights into the nature of
    our world and false claims about reality.

  <p>
    The current <b>materialistic</b> view of the world in which everything
    is studied <b>in isolation</b> is <b>depriving man from his spiritual foundation</b> which in turn <b>prevents a complete understanding of the natural laws</b>, for <b>nothing exists in isolation</b>
    and everywhere we look at, from the tiniest molecules to the biggest galaxies, we can see how everything in the universe works in an evermore complex interrelationship, and from this complexity a duality seems to appear;
    a duality between flourishing energies and decomposing energies, between caos and order (similarly to the analogy I gave before about the light and darkness in the beginning),
    between the masculine and the feminine principle or between physical matter and the spiritual as taoism has historically pointed out.
    It is not my intent to try and address the topic about the metaphysics of reality in this article so I would like to simply define the spiritual foundation as that same internal light I used at the beginning as
    an analogy to describe the functioning of our mind or, in other words, the faculty that every human being possesses which enables him to direct his thought towards any direction by self-will.
    Therefore, we can understand that <b>life flourishes in complexity and in an interdependance of which we are inextricably a part of</b>; something which imbues every aspect of nature with an emanating beauty.
  </p>
  <p>
    If we consider the fact that the life of every human being flows in between two worlds, the world of facts and the world of symbols or ideas, we can then see how the transcendental problem humanity has always faced
    has always been about the relationship around these two worlds which form the complete landscape of the psychofisical experience of man. If we give primacy to the world of facts, we enclose the totallity of reality
    in a materialistic view of the world, while if primacy is given to the world of symbols, we fall in the mistake of converting into dogma the ideas created by men, something which invevitably separates man from the
    truth he craves to discover. It is for this reason we have to be very careful with giving excesive importance and the value we give to ideas and even more so when collectives of people take for granted ideas without
    questioning them, for this automatically closes the door to the continuous search for truth, a process <b>every person needs to take individually</b> and contrasting it with real life experience, as a form of revival
    of the phoenix, where the ashes can be considered as the burden that used to anchor us to our false facts (The archetype of the phoenix has been widely studied throughout history by great figures of humanity such as
    Carl Gustav Jung, who dedicated a great study about this in his book "Symbols of transformation").
  </p>
  <p>
    During the last decades climate change has had an increasing attention of the media and anyone worried with the effects of man-made
    climate change, which is a good sign of an increase in <b>care</b> and <b>attention</b> to a world increasingly influenced by the hand of man.
    The problem begins when people start believing alarming news about the end of the world and the damages caused by a capitalist
    society, instead of <b>looking for the evidence</b> and <b>rejecting false claims</b>.

    You see, this problem of accepting information at face value means
    any new evidence which contradicts your point of view will cause you to reject it or simply to disregard it. Sounds a bit like dogmatic religion yet?
    The enemy of humanity has always been dogmatism, which is why our ancestors gave an extreme importance to always question authority, for ever since <b>Socrates</b>, the great Classical
    Greek Philosopher, taught us <b>the inescapable need to question dogma</b>,
    it is in each individual alone the posibility to break the shackles of imposition in favor of a scientific dissection and deconstruction of arguments and supposed "facts".

    <h4 class="color">Greta and her followers</h4>
    <p>
      The most notable example of this <b>dogmatic religion</b> being formed is the new appearance of a <b>messianic figure</b> (One who is regarded as the savior or liberator) Greta Thunberg, praised by the media and acclaimed by easily decieved people of all ages.
      Although many may not be aware, in 1992 there was a similar example of a young girl named Severn Suzuki who spoke in the United Nations. Severn insisted she represented the younger generation
      and how every country had failed the new generations allowing the holes in the Ozone layer to grow out of control. She even talked about how she feared going out on the streets due to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TJICmLMb06Y">the damage the sun rays
      would produce her.</a> This kind of alarmism tries to reach the emotional part of every human being, which makes it difficult to counter the arguments being presented without seeming to be a cold-hearted monster. The curious aspect of her story is that
      ever since the Montreal Protocol was passed in 1987 (yes, five years before she gave her speech) banning the production and use of the most damaging chemicals, the ozone layer hole has
      <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/science-environment-49714987">been reducing it's size</a>, so her message simply shone a light around an issue which was already being taken care of and changed for the better.
    </p>
    <p>
      This time around Greta tells a different story with a similar intention, that is, to make europeans feel guilty for a
      <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/larrybell/2013/01/22/the-u-n-s-global-warming-war-on-capitalism-an-important-history-lesson-2/#779184c029be">supposed ecological catastrophe caused by Capitalism</a>.
      What I want to focus your attention to is mostly the fact that an increasing number of people have accepted her message as valid and have never tried to understand the problems we face when trying to understand
      climate change at large.
      Anyone who has simply trusted her innocence and accepted her message at face value has a lot to learn about how the world works, for there are many different groups interested in pushing
      this propaganda like <a href="https://www.libremercado.com/2019-08-20/greta-thunberg-es-una-tapadera-que-oculta-un-suculento-negocio-a-cuenta-del-cambio-climatico-1276643504/">her parents, green energy lobbies
      and profesional publicists</a> who are all working together to push Greta to the public in order to advance their personal incentives and businesses.
      If a problem so complex could be reduced to an univariate dimension we would have solved it as soon as someone pointed it out, as happened with the ozone and the prohibition of certain harmful chemicals.
      By expressing this I dont mean to ridicule her as a person, for I believe she pinpoints at a problem which can have grave implications if it is not carefully attended to; my main issue is
      the use of the news media as a tool to advance the vision of this religion through the
      <a href="https://realclimatescience.com/climate-scientists-rewriting-the-past/">manipulation of science</a> which only serves to obscure the real problems and facts one
      should carefully analize.
    </p>
    <p>
      With the appearance of this messianic figure there has also appeared a new movement named Extinction Rebellion, Greta's personal entourage, a group dedicated to proselytizing this new
      anti-capitalist - and I would argue, anti-environmentalist - religion. Their main ideas are to disrupt the current standards of living of the most prosperous nations in the world through <b>political action</b>
      by dismantling current freedoms and economic systems which brought many people out of poverty, and to force everyone to accept a dramatic decrease in the global standard of living, based on the presuposition that
      we are at a critical level and this is a global emergency. For anyone who doesn't see the problem with this <b>mass delusion</b> maybe you should read about the life of
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ted_Kaczynski">Unabomber</a>, for there are many similarities in his movement and current trends in environmental movements. Unabomber - Theodore John Kaczynski - is a US citizen,
      mathematician and anarchist who had a been slowly developing a dangerous view about the world around him and how industrial capitalism was the main culprit of the destruction of humanity, something he later wrote in a
      manifesto named <a href="https://archive.nytimes.com/www.nytimes.com/library/national/unabom-manifesto-1.html">Industrial society and its future</a> - the Unabomber manifesto -, a manifesto where he stated the only way forward
      for mankind was to return to a <b>pre-industrial</b> state of nature in order to <b>save itself</b>. His crusade against the world changed him into a domestic terrorist, <b>killing people to push his message forward</b> to the point where he stated he would
      not stop until The Times or The Washington Post published his manifesto for the world to see. As we can see, the problem appears when an idea turns into an unmovable dogma, plaguing people's minds with extremist ideas
      and a sense of global urgency, if these same individuals never try to scientifically study their assumptions then the ideas naturally grow in their minds as a form of delusion or an escape from reality and this is
      <a href="https://capitalresearch.org/article/unabombers-without-bombs-part-1/">one of the many reasons</a> why we should always keep a distant perspective about groups being formed in the name of a greater good such as in the case
      of Extinction Rebellion and its followers.
    </p>
    <p>
      If one is to humbly accept the fact that climate change has always happend and <b>will continue to happen</b>, we could begin to study the problem by increasing spending in Research and Investigation, rather than imposing sanctions and restrictions which only work to the detriment
      of the whole population. By the way, the European Union represents <b>only 13% of the global CO2 emissions in the world</b>, so if one was to take seriously the message pushed by Greta then the message would have more impact on China or India since they produce <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_carbon_dioxide_emissions">more than 35% of the global emissions</a> and have had a major increase in emissions,
      mostly due to the fact <b>they have opened their economies to a more global market</b> and <b>started fuelling its energy demands with coal burning</b>, something which has pushed many people into the middle class. Of course, that is something which won't happen because the aim of
      this movement is to heighten the sense of <b>disarray</b> in Europeans and western society in exchange for <b>higher regulations and restrictions</b> imposed by the ruling class; in short, one of the aims of this movement is to manipulate the masses into a distorted view of reality
      so they can <b>exploit them</b> and <b><a href="https://www.thenewamerican.com/rio-20/item/12008-the-real-agenda-behind-un-%E2%80%9Csustainability%E2%80%9D-unmasked">increase the size of governments</a></b>.
      I will bring useful information and clear data later in the article but for now I wanted to make clear that <b>in order for anyone to have a more clear understanding about the effects of climate change they must first stop accepting any fatalistic or dramatic declarations about the end of the world</b> (dogmatic religion)
      and <b>begin by humbly looking for the evidence</b> which is more often that not ommitted by most media outlets.

    <h4 class="color">The innovators</h4>
    <p>I wonder why so many people blindly follow a girl who's message oversimplifies a very complex problem, but almost nobody has heard about the invention a young teenager created to clear most of the plastics which are piling up on the surface of our oceans.
      If you have never heard of <a href="https://theoceancleanup.com/">Boyan Slat and the Ocean Cleanup</a> or about <a href="https://www.sherrimason.com/publications">Sherri Mason and her studies on the widespread appearance of microplastics</a>, then maybe it's time you <b>stop trusting in the same media</b> which have pushed the idea of a young girl being an important element of the fight against Global Warming and maybe you <b>should start doing your own research</b>.
      Boyan and his team came up with a bold plan to clean up more than 90% of the plastic in the ocean when he was just a teenager, and in just 7 years has reached many milestones in his journey.
      More recently his team has developed a system called <a href="https://theoceancleanup.com/rivers/">The Interceptor</a> to catch all the plastic they can in the rivers before it reaches the ocean.
      This is a non-profit organization, which means every revenue they get will be returned to the company in order to keep improving and building better systems of cleaning.
      This project is having and will continue to have a staggering impact in the health of the environment and should make anyone rejoice and smile at such a feat of a young boy's imagination.
      This is just one example of what patience and discipline joined with a creative mind can bring forth into the betterment of our society and environment at large.
      I wanted to focus in the fact that it is a <b>non-profit organization</b> to show how <b>you dont have to be an activist or an environmantalist demanding political change in order to make a profound impact on our planet</b>.
      The <a href="https://theoceancleanup.com/milestones/how-it-all-began/">story of Boyan Slat</a> should serve as an example of how <b>an emerging problem can bring about the attention of entrepreneurs to find the means and the investments necessary to unfold their plans to eliminate such a problem</b>, something that makes his story a truly inspiring one.

    <p>
      Another example of how an individual can have a huge impact in the betterment of the world around them is the case of <a href="https://paulstamets.com/">Paul Stamets</a>, a famous mycologist who has dedicated his
      entire life to the study of fungi, has made some <b>breakthrough discoveries</b> about the function of mycelium and mushrooms on the environment and its <b>invaluable capacity to revert changes we have produced to the environment</b>
      such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Desertification">desertification</a>, the <a href="https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/ocean-s-oxygen-starts-running-low/">deoxygenation of oceans</a> and the ongoing
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holocene_extinction">Holocene exctintion</a>. Mycelia consume food externally, by secreting powerful enzymes that break down molecules, thus decomposing the surface they are growing on into valuable nutrients.
      Paul Stamets found out we can use the ability of mushrooms to digest almost anything to our advantage through <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mycoremediation">mycoremediation</a>.
      Mycelium have many capabilities and they are bound to be <b>essential to nature's survival</b> as well as ours, here I present some of mycelium's abilities:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Mycelium can decompose <a href="https://fungi.com/blogs/articles/the-petroleum-problem">crude oil</a>.</li>
      <li>Mycelium can remove <a href="https://cfpub.epa.gov/ncer_abstracts/index.cfm/fuseaction/display.highlight/abstract/590/report/F">heavy metals</a> or damaging chemicals from water like, for example, many byproducts of pharmaceutical companies.</li>
      <li><a href="https://www.yesmagazine.org/environment/2019/03/05/mushrooms-clean-up-toxic-mess-including-plastic-why-arent-they-used-more/">Plastics</a> can be broken down by mycelium, something we can use to reduce the plastic footprint.</li>
      <li>Adding <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mycorrhiza">mycorrhizal fungi</a> to soil can improve crop yields by providing inmunity for paired species against pathogens, therefore reducing the need of any pesticides.</li>
      <li>Pairing symbiotic mushrooms with compatible plant and tree species in forests can help improve the reforestation of areas severly damaged by wildfires or by clearcut logging.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      Now, having talked about this quasi-religious and dogmatic view of Global Warming and its counterpart, a more rational approach to a problem as in the case of Boyan Slat and Paul Stamets; I would like to present some information and facts about the effects of climate change on the planet.
      In order to make this article more valuable I will like to briefly introduce the Scientific method so each one of us can analize the data we are being presented anywhere and try and understand it's usefulness.

  <p>The Scientific Method, the method by which science is carried out, involves <b>building hypothesis based on previous observations about a phenomenon</b> (induction, in other words, going from the specific observation to the more general idea),
   the study of <b>the implications of this hypothesis and its effects on reality</b> (deduction, in other words, going from the general idea to the specific observation)and <b>the experimental testing of this hypothesis</b> which must be <b>verifiable</b> and <b>repeatable/replicable</b> by anyone following the
   same steps. This method allows for predictions to appear as a consequence of studying a phenomenon and the successive discarding of information that is erroneous or not corresponding with reality.
   It is this predictions which can then be tested for it's ability to explain the phenomenon studied. <b>If we can successfully predict an event from a given initial hypothesis through experiment we say we have a
   new scientific truth</b>, which will be once again replaced by a new hypothesis which can explain reality with greater precision.

    <li>Miguel Servet(1509-1553): <a href="https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miguel_Servet">"In the Bible, there is no mention of the Trinity… We get to know God, not through our proud philosophical concepts, but through Christ."</a> Spanish theologian, was burned at the stake for proposing a different view on the Trinity and of Christ.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    Having cleared this concept out we must remember <b>the science of climate change is of a very recent origin and the modern collection of data with respect
    to global temperatures only dates from as late as the 1880's</b>, although there are many accurate temperature recordings since the invention of the modern thermometer in the early 1700s which <a href="https://qz.com/1055629/why-does-all-our-climate-data-start-in-1880/">have not been digitalized</a>.
    Thus, whenever you hear we have broken a new temperature record remember, this is true only with respect to the last 100 years of available modern data, since monitoring global surface temperatures was not an easy feat until modern times.
  </p>
  <p>
    Finally, in order to wrap up the pre-requisite caracteristics of a scientific view of the world I want to clear out what I mean about <b>mass delusion</b> with regards to scientific understanding, for it is
    increasingly becoming a problem within our culture. People tend to get caught up in group patterns of thought which prevent them from individually analizing the ideas being pushed forward, this process automatically
    divides society into two groups of people, those who follow the group and <b>faithfully</b> accept their point of view as being the only correct option, thus divorcing any dissentment possibility from the group and
    exiling those who dare to present alternative perspectives. This last group have even recieved a term growing in use during the last decades, <b>climate deniers</b>, .
     <b>Science has never, and will never be, a list of static facts about our world for our ignorance is as big as our universe</b> and theories get revised and discarded as our civilization grows older and wiser.
    Even if we can assert certain facts about our world as "true enough", certainly the only "true enough" fact about climate change is exactly that; our climate <b>changes</b> and <b>will continue to do so forever</b>.
  </p>
  <p>
    Let me end with a phrase from a famous israeli astrophysicist named <a href="http://sciencebits.com/">Nir Shaviv</a> which calls directly towards this phenomenon of mass delusion and it's problems:
  </p>
  <blockquote class='border-left'>

      <i>
        Only people who don't understand science take the 97% consensus statistic seriously. Survey results depend on who you ask, who answers and how the questions are worded.

  <p>
    Let us now dive straight into some of the available data about climate change, with this it is not my intent to be exhaustive by any means for there is always more information than what is necessary to gain a basic and general perspective on the issue at hand.
    To begin, allow me to introduce a key graph showing the impact natural disasters have on human life:
  </p>
  <figure>

  </figure>
  <p>
    As we can see natural disasters caused by the climate have had a great impact in human life up until the second industrial revolution in the beginnings of the 20th Century, showing a <b>drastic reduction in deaths related to climate</b> mostly due to the fact that entire populations
    had been increasingly <b>becoming more rich and more resilient to natural disasters</b>. Whereas before the 20th Century climate related disasters killed more than half a million people each year, these same disasters now kill only just 20,000 people each year - a reduction of 95 per cent.
    As <a href="https://www.lomborg.com/">Bjorn Lomborg</a> correctly points out:
  </p>
  <blockquote class='border-left'>
    <p>
      <i>
        Policies that reduce poverty are climate policies. History has shown conclusively that making people richer and less vulnerable is one of the best ways to strengthen societies resilience to challenges such as climate threats. [...] The first priority would be to make policies

  </blockquote>
  <p>
    The United Nation's <a href="https://www.ipcc.ch/about/">Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change</a> (IPCC) is formed by a colective of scientists to assess the implications of anthropogenic changes in our climate and to further plans to implement national
    and international policies that would supposedly reduce the impact. The problem is the science gets easily manipulated by the <a href="http://climatechangereconsidered.org/about-the-ipcc/">bureaucrats and governments
    who control the IPCC</a> which has alarmed many scientist about the <b>politicization of science</b> and the detrimental effects of not only hiding information, but also inflating human impact while at the same time
    reducing the effect of solar and cosmic activity in the warming of the planet, something which should alarm any scientist for as stated before, any evidence discarding your previous assumptions should be taken into
    account to correctly describe a phenomenon.
  </p>
  <section id="sub-header-4">
    <h4 class="color">The influence of the sun</h4>
    <p>
      As the IPCC correctly points out: Global climate is determined by three primary influences on the planet; firstly is the solar energy
      recieved from the sun which is largely affected by changes in orbit of the earth around the sun; followed secondly by the solar energy reflected back out of the planet, due to the high reflection of polar ice caps
      - known as the <a href="https://nsidc.org/cryosphere/seaice/processes/albedo.html">albedo effect</a> -, aerosols and clouds/land cover; and lastly by the effects of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere which can trap
      more of the solar energy inside the planet instead of reflecting it.
      Most of the data gathered around global temperatures and gas composition of the atmosphere comes from different sources such as ice cores, tree rings, ocean sediments, coral reefs and layers of sedimentary rock.
      All these sources point towards a warming of the planet, something which has happened before many times and will continue to happen, for the earth continually moves through cycles of ice ages and global warming,
      the key questions are if the anthropogenic effects on the climate are causing the rise in temperatures or if it's effects are negligible in contrast to the effects of the sun.
    </p>
    <figure>
      <a href="/images/posts/Nature/ClimateChange/sealevelNirShaviv.jpeg"><img src="/images/posts/Nature/ClimateChange/sealevelNirShaviv.jpeg" alt="Almost perfect correlation between sea level and amount of solar activity."></a>
      <figcaption class="caption-text">Almost perfect correlation with sea level changes and solar activity. <a href="https://business.financialpost.com/opinion/carbon-week-the-sun-raises-the-seas">Image source</a></figcaption>
    </figure>
    <p>
      In the image we can appreciate how the rise in sea level has an almost perfect correlation with the incident solar flux in our oceans, a fact which shows us with absolute clarity how the sun does indeed have measurable
      effects on the planet's climate.
      So even though the IPCC doesn't seem to like the <a href="http://hyperphysics.phy-astr.gsu.edu/hbase/thermo/solact.html">evidence linking solar activity
      and cosmic rays to global warming</a>, the effects and the correlations with global warming are much higher than the models based on increases in carbon dioxide.
      In the same way NASA argues that <a href="">the Milankovitch cycles cannot explain the rise in temperatures</a> providing as only evidence the fact that during the last 40 years solar activity has decreased, something
      which for them confirms that the rise in temperatures must be atributed to the rise in carbon dioxide emisions. The problem with this argument lies in not taking into account that a reduction in solar activity during a
      relatively small time period does not necessarily mean that temperature must go down as a consequence, rather that the <b>rate of increase</b> of the temperature will decrease inasmuch as solar activity continues to
      decrease, something which helps understand how temperatures can keep going up despite having a reduction in solar activity.
    </p>
    <p>
      If we consider the fact that the effects caused by the variations in the cosmic rays flux (cosmic rays are a type of <a href="">ionizing radiation</a>, in other words, particles formed by protons with big energetic
      charges which appear in Earth's surface originating from neighbouring supernovas) also contribute to global warming, we can start having a better picture of the overall causes of global warming in our planet,
      for as Nir Shaviv explains, there are <a href="">empirical evidences which directly link the cosmic rays flux with the formation of clouds around Earth's atmosphere</a>.
      Therefore, while some have closed the door to new evidences which may contradict their facts, there are still some scientists which keep fighting to contribute to our understanding around the different influences to our climate.
      In another <a href="">study done by Nir Shaviv</a> about the relationship between solar activity and the temperature on Earth, he claims that the sun has a significant impact on the climate, atributing around a 40% of the increase
      in temperatures to the effect of solar activity and the other 60% due to anthropogenic activity, something which can be clearly shown in the following graph:
    </p>
    <figure>
      <a href="/images/posts/Nature/ClimateChange/RadiativeForcings.png"><img src="/images/posts/Nature/ClimateChange/RadiativeForcings.png" alt="Radiative forcing contributions."></a>
      <figcaption class="caption-text">Radiative forcing contributions to the planet. <a href="http://www.sciencebits.com/solar-debunking-arguments-are-defunct">Image source</a></figcaption>
    </figure>
    <p>
      By radiative forcing we mean any change in the radiation, incoming or outgoing, ocurring in a climatic system, therefore, as we can see in the graph human activity causes a clear contribution towards the warming of the
      planet. The key in the graph is the part about the energetic changes atributed to the sun; where the IPCC atributes a radiative forcing of close to zero while in color beige we can see the true influence which can be
      atributed to the sun according to Nir Shaviv, something which makes evident <b>the blatant lie the IPCC wants to push forward to disimulate the effects caused by the sun</b>. The last important piece of data in the graph is
      the green bar which refers to the authentic radiative forcing when we take into account the effects of the sun studied by Nir Shaviv, something which importantly modifies the <a href="">original graph promoted by the IPCC</a>.
      Clearly this should be further investigated if we are going to pursue the reality about climate change and not to try and impose devious causes about it.
    </p>
    <p>
      In any case it is clear solar activity, <a href="https://principia-scientific.org/top-astrophysicist-warns-of-cosmic-rays-climate-impact/">cloud cover modulated by cosmic rays</a> and greenhouse
      gases contribute to the warming and cooling of the planet and further research should be our top priority to have a chance at improving our capacity to predict the changes in climate
      in the future, something which by the way is very hard to predict for the simple reason that in systems with so many variables such as our climate, the further in time you want to predict any change the bigger the
      compounding effect of each variable and thus the higher the uncertainty of the predictions (This obviously does not happen in closed systems in which all the variables are known for in this cases we can always calculate the
      consequences of any changes in the system).
    </p>
    <figure>
    <a href="/images/posts/Nature/ClimateChange/temperatureprediction.png"><img src="/images/posts/Nature/ClimateChange/temperatureprediction.png" alt="Superposition of two graphics showing the predicted temperature changes for the following 100 years, based on a graph by Nir Shaviv and another by the IPCC."></a>
    <figcaption class='caption-text'>Superposition of two graphs, one by Nir Shaviv in black and the other by the IPCC, showing the predictions in temperature change for the next 100 years. <a href="https://youtu.be/a--kc5dbvyQ?t=949">Image source</a></figcaption>
    </figure>
    <p>
      Based on the models employed by Nir Shaviv which do take into consideration the effects of the solar activity, the estimations for the future are more benign than those proposed by the IPCC which clearly elevate the level of
      uncertainty and present us with a more alarmist vision.
      It should now be clear that the further in time you try and predict changes in the climate, the bigger the uncertainty or the "fork of possibilities" become.
      Nevertheless, this is being presented in the media as if we had the technology to accurately predict the temperature the planet will have in the next decades. Again, this only helps fuel a mass hysteria and a sense
      of desesperation which only serves to
      <a href="https://www.libremercado.com/2019-12-03/manuel-llamas-el-gran-cuento-verde-ni-ecologismo-ni-consenso-cientifico-ni-emergencia-climatica-89397/">increase political repression and dictatorial
      policies</a> around countries which should be pressing all their efforts into improving their ability to analize and detect changes in green house gases and temperature through the correct investing of better technology.
    </p>
    <p>
      Even though <b>the impact of solar and anthropogenic activity may not be well gauged with today's technology</b>, we most certainly can be sure that in such a complex system as the climate of our planet, <b>any perturbation to the system will most definitely cause many repercussions</b>
      which will be unpredictable and may push us towards a <b>faster decline in environmental wellbeing</b>. It is for this reason, that we must make sure the perturbations we produce in the climate are of a <b>neutral or positive and enlivening effect</b> towards the betterment and conservation of natural cycles
      for the preservation of both the animal and plant kingdoms.
    </p>
    <p>
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syukuro_Manabe">Syukuro Manabe</a>, famous climatologist and one of the pioneers in the use of computers to model global climate change, has some good insights into
      the effects of <a href="https://youtu.be/oaRcI0XJ640">greenhouse gases in our atmosphere</a>. In his more than 50 years of work around climate models he understands one of the most challenging tasks of climate science
      is to determine the <i>sensitivity</i> of climate. This term is generally defined as "the response of the global mean surface temperature to the doubling of atmospheric concentration of carbon dioxide"; the main problem being the
      uncertainty attributed to the clouds and its effects on temperature at surface levels, something which is being increasingly studied in order to increase the precision of models. The reason I wanted to introduce Syukuro
      is to show how one of the most important investigators in the study of climate change is very knowledgeable on the limits of his models to predict the climate,for even though <b>climate models</b> are becoming more precise
      and increasingly effective in studying climate variations, they <b>are not close to the ideal state where they can make good predictions about our climate</b>,
      which is a reason why <b>we should not trust the predictions being pushed</b> around news media in regards to global warming.
    </p>
    <p>
      To study global warming we must also take into account that although the north pole has been <a href="https://climate.nasa.gov/vital-signs/arctic-sea-ice/">loosing glaciar cover</a>, something which could account for a decrease in reflected solar energy, a <a href="https://www.nasa.gov/content/goddard/antarctic-sea-ice-reaches-new-record-maximum">NASA study</a> has found that
      Antartica sea ice is reaching new record maximum. If we are to truly understand the changes that govern our planet we <b>must start seeing nature and it's processes as a living being</b>;
      with each inbreath and outbreath taking thousands of years to complete; and water, in all its forms, as being the lifeblood of the planet, cycling nutrients and carrying minerals around.

    <h4 class="color">An extraordinary friend of life</h4>
    <p>
      Let's now focus our attention on Carbon Dioxide, the greenhouse gas which has attracted most of the media attention and seems to be the culprit of all the evil and warming of our planet.
      Carbon Dioxide, being formed by a carbon atom and two oxygen atoms joined together by a covalent bond, sits at the base of all life cycles on earth; being used by the plant kingdom as a source of
      energy and as a prerequisite to producing growth and fruiting bodies; and by the animal kingdom as an essential compound in order to sustain celular life. Biological lifeforms
      throughout history have <b>reduced the amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere and increased it's oxygen content</b>, allowing more complex lifeforms to benefit from this increasing richness in oxygen.
      Carbon is associated with most lifeforms and it's effect in the cycle of life is <b>crucial</b>. This means a big variation in the amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere can have unpredictable consequences
      in many lifeforms on earth. Being such an important compound we must point out the benefits of such <b>an extraordinary friend of life</b> which, generally keeps
      getting portrayed as an obstacle or an intruder in the wellness of life on this planet.
    </p>

    </figure>
    <p>
      As we can read from the graph, during the latter part of the Carboniferous, the Permian and the first half of the Triassic period, roughly 250-320 million years ago, <b>the concentration of carbon dioxide
      in the atmosphere was half what it is today while the temperature was 10ºC higher than today</b>.
      If we look at the Cretaceus period towards the Eocene, roughly 35 to 100 million years ago, <b>a decrease of carbon dioxide was accompanied by high temperature values</b>.
      Scientists have also noted that an increase in carbon dioxide was always preceded by an increase in temperature decades or centuries in advance, something which can be explained when we understand that
      oceans act as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon_sink">carbon sinks</a>, storing most of the carbon dioxide in it's underground cold currents, and increased solar radiation reaching the
      oceans end up warming and melting ice caps, which in return transfer new concentrations of cold water downwards thereby releasing the trapped carbon dioxide upwards to the atmosphere.
    </p>
    <p>
      Drawing on this point about the vital cycles which occur in our oceans lets see how marine phytoplankton can help regulate the carbon dioxide and oxygen levels on the atmosphere and the oceans through the cycle known as the
      <a href="https://serc.carleton.edu/eslabs/carbon/6a.html">biological pump</a>. As atmospheric carbon dioxide is absorbed by the oceans, marine phytoplakton use it in addition to sunlight (solar energy) to photosynthesize,
      producing a range of chemical compounds and structural polymers as well as oxygen in the process and help to remove about <b>one-third</b> of the atmospheric carbon dioxide.
    </p>

      Outside of the oceans, green biomass achieves the same <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biosequestration">Biosequestration</a>(The capacity to capture and store the greenhouse gases) in order to enhance the life of the Plant and Animal kingdom,
      interchanging carbon dioxide for oxygen.
      Oxygen is the most abundant gas in the atmosphere at 21% by volume, whereas <b>carbon dioxide fills only 0.04% (400ppm) of the atmosphere</b> gases by volume and although this may seem a small amount, <b>it is precisely carbon dioxide the main reason
      we have these oxygen levels and a flourishing of life in the biosphere</b>.

      According to a new study published in the journal <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/nclimate3004"><i>Nature</i></a>, many of the earth's vegetated lands (from a quearter to half
      the total land cover) have shown <b>significant greening over the last 35 years</b> largely due to rising levels of carbon dioxide.
    </p>
    <p>
      Another <a href="https://www.nasa.gov/feature/goddard/2016/nasa-study-rising-carbon-dioxide-levels-will-help-and-hurt-crops">study published by NASA</a> has recently shown how <b>increased carbon dioxide levels actually
      increase crop yields</b> for many agricultural farms due to an increased rate of photosynthesis which consequently reduces the amount of water lost through transpiration on the leaves, something which aligns with the
      findings all around the world of a general increase in crop yields over the last decades.
      Although an increase in carbon dioxide seems to improve the growth of certain plants, it is clear that an increase in temperature is detrimental for the soils and can cause more drawbacks due to increased exposure
      to heat waves or less moisture of soil.
      The effects of increased temperatures can still be counteracted by a more controlled environment and by keeping good soil composition, allowing plants to achieve greater rates of yields while
      maintaining a high nutritional intake from the waters and the soil.

      The effects of global temperature on human civilizations has been long studied by many anthropologists and paleoclimatologists such as <a href="">Brian Fagan</a>, who more recently published a book titled
      <a href="https://leer.amazon.es/kp/embed?asin=B0047DVI5M&preview=newtab&linkCode=kpe&ref_=cm_sw_r_kb_dp_M6UkEbZS4VN9X">The Great Warming</a> in which he studies the climate from the Holocene until our
      recent times. In the book he takes a detailed look into the effects of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medieval_Warm_Period">medieval warm period</a>, a term coined by paleoclimatologist
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hubert_Lamb">H. Lamb</a>, starting somewhere around 800 A.C with a progressive rise in temperatures until approximately 1200 A.C, where average temperatures rose by
      more than one degree causing a surplus of harvest for many farmers and peasants. This period of time is characterized by being a benign period with respect to climate catastrophes, something which took a turn
      to worse during the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Little_Ice_Age">little ice age</a> which spanned from the 16th Century up until the 19th Century. As we can see, our planet has had periods of global warming
      followed by periods of decreases in temperatures and glaciations and in general humanity and the natural world has been better off during periods of warmer temperatures, where a surplus of life seems to dominate
      the planet.
      Although increases in temperature can also damage various ecosystems and propiciate a desertification of certain landscapes, it is in our hands to investigate the overall effects of this changes and keep studying
      the implications of increases in temperatures and  carbon dioxide levels in the atmosphere, something which may help us in preventing damages to our soil and crop yields in the future to come.

    Having started my article with a religious analogy for the present dogma around climate change and how many scientists have not only muddled the information but also knowingly denied key evidence in order to push a
    politicized view of climate change, I wanted to finish with a few key elements about Capitalism to help understand the implications of a planet in which we will be growing richer and more prosperous.
    First and foremost it's fair to say <b>capitalism is the only human socio-economic structure which has given human beings a freedom and potential to grow in prosperity like no other in history</b>,
    unlike <b>communism which has always promised prosperity and peace but always delivers the exact opposite, misery and war</b>. With respect to communism I would like to reference a quote, without the slightest
    intent to plagiarize, from a spanish writer named

    Prosperity and peace have always been an utopic milestone any human civilization has strived to conquer but it seems never have we been closer to this objective until recent years once entire nations

  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Right_to_property">the right to private property</a>, which has allowed for the individual to rise above the tirany of the

    For anyone convinced capitalism is the main source of all problems I would like to recommend a beautiful and simple article written for the website <a href="https://quillette.com/about/">Quillette</a>,
    titled <a href="https://quillette.com/2019/03/10/the-clear-case-for-capitalism/">"The Clear Case for Capitalism"</a>.

    For anyone interested in finding how our world has changed for the better during the last decades I would strongly recomend reading Steven Pinker's book:
    <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Better-Angels-Our-Nature-Violence/dp/0143122010">The Better Angels of our Nature</a> in which the author documents
    the evidence to support the claim of a decline in violence and an increase in prosperity through five basic "historical forces" as he calls them:
  </p>
  <ul class='numeral-list'>
    <li class="numeral">The Leviathan - The rise of modern nation-state and judiciary with a monopoly on the legitimate use of force.</li>
    <li class="numeral">Commerce - The rise of technological progress allowing the exchange of goods and services over longer distances.</li>
    <li class="numeral">Feminization - Increasing respect for the interest and values of women.</li>
    <li class="numeral">Cosmopolitanism - The rise of forces such as literacy, mobility and mass media.</li>
    <li class="numeral">The Escalator of Reason - An intensifying application of knowledge and rationality to prevent violent problem solving.</li>
  </ul>

    <h4 class="color">The value of the individual</h4>
    <p>
      Although I am showing the benefits of capitalism, I am not here to defend the capitalistic mindview since, as any other system through which we can mediate human interaction, it is <b>susceptible
      to corruption and can produce disastrous damage to our natural world if the individual is not allowed to - or is not willing to - make the right decisions and take a more sustainable approach</b>.
      I believe <b>the individual is the key component of a truly functional and sustainable society</b> in which an abundance of information can be handled by a truly open and healthy debate with the
      most important tool we have, which is <b>free speech</b>, with which we can practice dissentment and reach ever higher conclusions thereby discarding false claims.
      An increasing diversity of choice in terms of energy, resources such as food and water, and a truly free market can also drive the individual to make better choices for him, his family and society
      at large. This are the reasons why <b>I profoundly believe the individual is the key component of change in our society</b> and why I will always tend to listen and learn from people like
      Boyan Slat or Paul Stamets, who are changing our view of what's possible in the world, instead of listening to people like Greta Thunberg or whoever comes next who can only throw the blame on the rest of society
      instead of firstly, looking within, and then, once they have changed themselves, start helping the rest of society.
    </p>
    <p>
      I want to make a distinction between how an individual percieves himself and how the rest of society sees them, for in our modern world people have grown used to calling themselves environmentalists
      and heavenly beings who would never even hurt a living being, something which to me just sounds like a <b>big "Ego" problem</b> because an individual's value should not be measured by his words but
      <b>by his actions</b>. So I would tend to hold in high regard any individual who, <b>through his actions</b>, brings a better and more just world in which to live in for his fellow citizens, or even
      just for himself, <b>than anyone who starts crowning himself with different adjectives about his worthiness and extraordinary moral standards</b>, something which only shows their incredibly shallow
      and empty ways of thinking.
    </p>

    <h4 class="color">The real anthropogenic damage</h4>
    <p>
      Lastly, I want to take a moment to talk about some of the problems most relevant to the issue at hand, specifically about recent wildfires which have been striking our planet from every corner of the world;
      from the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2019/08/24/world/americas/amazon-rain-forest-fire-maps.html">devouring wildfires in the Amazon jungle</a> to the most recent wildfires in Australia.
      I have been placing an emphasis on the individual and its worthiness through his actions precisely because this information you are about to read serve as incredible examples of how corrupt
      the human heart can become and how political incentives and personal prosperity can force an individual to hide in the facade of being a beautiful and grandiose human being, but producing
      the exact opposite effects on the world around them.
      Last months we where all paying close attention to the wildfires being spread across the Amazonian rainforest, and although president
      <a href="https://edition.cnn.com/2019/11/30/world/leonardo-dicaprio-bolsonaro-amazon-fires-trnd/index.html?utm_medium=social&utm_content=2019-12-01T09%3A00%3A28&utm_source=fbCNNi&utm_term=link&fbclid=IwAR0yVB9iEhrhiqWrSp-Q2pn6_R6gRww0y3v8R-_PUvDdTOwbSiK70niIems">
      Jairo Bolsonaro claimed Activists and NGO's where the culprits of the fires</a>, it remains to be proved and for the time being the only real evidence we have is his government's
      increasingly lax laws and regulations which do not protect the Amazon rainforest.
      Acording to <i>Science</i> magazine, forest fires are caused by deforestation practices used to extract timber for commercial use and for expansion of agricultural lands, something which
      <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/amazon-burns-brazil-s-bolsonaro-tells-rest-world-not-interfere-n1045666">Bolsonaro has repeatedly encouraged</a>, stating Brazil should open the Amazon
      up to business interests such as mining, agricultural and logging companies.
      Although it is easy to blame a single figure for causing the wildfires, it is clear this is the joined effort of many companies and interests both in the regional landscape aswell as internationally
      who are motivated by profits and don't care about the destruction of the Amazonian rainforest.
    </p>
    <p>
      In Bolivia, Evo Morales passed <a href="https://www.derechoteca.com/gacetabolivia/decreto-supremo-no-3973-del-10-de-julio-de-2019/">a new bill</a> which allows the burning of new forest areas in
      order to <a href="https://news.mongabay.com/2019/10/fires-still-being-set-in-blazing-bolivia-commentary/">increase agricultural land use</a> and, of course,

      More recently in Australia, <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-australia-50951043">devastating wildfires</a> have burned <b>more than 63 000 square kilometers</b>, killing <b>over 800 million
      animals</b> and leaving thousands of people unable to save their homes.
      Australia is facing rising temperatures and increasing dryness caused partially by the <a href="http://www.bom.gov.au/climate/enso/history/ln-2010-12/IOD-what.shtml">Indian Ocean Dipole</a>, which
      causes the west side of the Indian Ocean to become warmer while the east side becomes cooler, causing a decrease in rainfall over Australia.
      Although blame has been placed over global warming, <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/International/24-australians-arrested-deliberately-setting-fires-season/story?id=68108272">over
      100 people have been arrested</a> <b>for causing some of these fires</b>, meaning it is human action, not climate change, which causes so much destruction of natural landscapes and although certain
      factors have increased the potency of the fires (elevated temperatures and increases in drought), the only way we can stop this wildfires is through higher jail sentences for arson and by bettering
      our preservation of natural landscapes through active measures such as <a href="https://www.dpaw.wa.gov.au/management/fire/prescribed-burning">prescribed burning</a>, something which, by the way,
      <a href="https://www.dpaw.wa.gov.au/management/fire/fire-and-the-environment/41-traditional-aboriginal-burning">australian aboriginals have been doing for over 40 000 years</a>.
      <b>If the build up of fuel (dead plants, leaves and dry wood in the most part) is not correctly controled by means of prescribed burning or other forms of
      <a href="http://www.hillside.rfsa.org.au/fwhaz.htm">hazard reduction</a> then the only possible outcome is the catastrophic wildfires we are experiencing</b> wether they are caused by humans or
      by natural causes.
    </p>
    <p>
      For anyone interested in finding out what one of the problems with Australia and droughts is, please watch the short video below which gives an example of how the droughts have been manufactured
      by private companies benefiting from the redirection of natural water flow.
    </p>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/i9prJ_NsAo4">Video Source</a>
    <p>
      It is important to note that <b>the droughts have been artificially manufactured through human activity</b> such as
      <a href="https://theconversation.com/dams-are-being-built-but-they-are-private-australia-institute-124807">private dams</a> being constructed which prevent rivers from following its natural course.
      This same human activity is what caused a <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/magazine-22522695"><b>massive import of camels</b> from Afghanistan and British India</a> during the 19th Century's gold rush as a form
      of transport and construction, something which doesn't come without its repercussions for we are now seeing the <b>devastating effects of bringing invasive species into new environments</b>; like for example the
      increases in droughts caused by the decline in human use of camels since the arrival of modern transport machinery which forced the camels to adapt to the wildlife, increasing the damage done to the flora,
      trampling on vegetation and competing with native animals for shelter.
      The economic damages of this feral camels are also a big problem in Australia to the point where they are faced with the option to
      <a href="https://www.theaustralian.com.au/nation/politics/shooters-get-green-light-to-cull-10000-feral-camels/news-story/628b6454ed43e67ba1412d72d5389250">eliminate feral camels by the thousands</a> just to aleviate
      a problem which can be traced back to a human origin, a solution which, by the way, is being portrayed as helping alieviate the effects of climate change by reducing the "methane emitters".
    </p>
    <p>
      Here I would like to briefly present a historical event of great significance which appeared during the period of communist China under Mao, in order to shed a light into the idea I tried to convey throughout this article
      with regards to how a dogmatic approach can accelerate the downfall into caos. In 1958 Mao Zedong directed a campaign aimed at the control or <b>elimination of plagues</b> which was to be known as
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Four_Pests_Campaign">the Four Pests Campaign</a>, these plagues included rats, flies, mosquitoes and sparrows. People where rewarded for their participation in directly
      eliminating these species, something which only served to create an enormous <b>ecological imbalance</b>; this in turn caused the crop yields from the following years to quickly deteriorate, for the diminishing
      populations of sparrows caused other species such as worms and locusts to devastate the crops, thus accelerating the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Chinese_Famine">Great Chinese Famine</a>.
      This <b>quick deterioration of an environment</b> is due to an effect termed as <b><a href="https://missionwolf.org/trophic-cascade/">trophic cascade</a></b>, and in short, it means <b>whenever a predator is removed from an ecosystem
      all subsequent elements in that predator's food chain turn more caotic and can not only produce great imbalances in the ecosystem, but it can have such repercussions that it physically alters the environment the predator
      used to live in</b>. For anyone interested in this phenomenon of nature there is a great documentary titled "how wolves change rivers" which <b>clearly</b> explains the repercussions of removing predators from their habitat:
    </p>
    <div class="videowrapper">

      These consant intromissions in the cycles of nature by humans cause a lot of trouble for existing species which depend on such ecological environments and a dynamic equilibrium between them. This will continue until every
      individual opens their eyes, strives to always go to the <b>root of the problem</b> and finally acts upon the problem by changing his actions in society; be it through a personal change in daily habits or through the
      shedding of old ones.
    </p>
    <p>
      Another example of this problem is the change in food habits in favor of a more vegan lifestyle, a trend growing in followers during the last decades, mostly due to a resurgance of the importance of a healthier diet with
      the appearance of soy based products, almond milks and many other plant based foods; something which may seem like a more ecologically friendly solution to the excesses of meat consumption,
      but if one does not find out how the foods are produced (again, finding the root of the problems), they can be exacerbating the same problem they intended to solve as I will briefly show with the following example.
    </p>
    <p>
      The expansion of beef, soy and palm oil plantations as a result of changes in consumer habits are the <a href="https://globalforestcoalition.org/forest-cover-55-big-four-drivers-of-deforestation/">main deforestation</a>
      drivers of this decades at par with wood consumption for energy purposes. Many of the soy and palm oil plantations are created in areas previously used for beef production which have now been <b>repurposed as plantations</b>, but
      this <b>increase in demand</b> has driven further <b>deforestation</b> in order to increase production to satisfy such <b>demands</b>, thus worsening the previous situation of deforestation for cattle raise. Another problem
      arises from the use of bees in almond orchards and other plantations to pollinize the flowers, a fundamental part of the process of producing fruiting bodies which can later be sold in the market; the problem being the pathogens
      and parasites common to <b>monoculture</b> orchards which deprive the ecosystem of the natural protection against such agents, thus further increasing the need to use pesticides to solve the problem (again, a problem
      with its roots in the human influence by organizing crops into monocultures) by protect crops; this chemical pesticides are detrimental to the
      wellbeing of bees, who are exposed to these contaminants consequently causing the <b>inevitable death of large proportions of bees</b> who can't find inmunological protection within their range of activity.
      <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/jan/07/honeybees-deaths-almonds-hives-aoe">The Guardian</a> made eco of this problem occurring within a market that will only keep expanding with the coming years and
      with a lot of investments poured into sustaining a broken and unsustainable form of mass food production.
    </p>
    <p>
      If this doesn't seem like a big problem because you believe a movement from meat consumption to vegan diets will ultimately solve any problems,
      I am afraid you might be missing the point, which is: <b>any action you take based on your habits needs to be deeply studied and its repercussions understood</b>, for the mere change of habits does not solve the underlying
      issues regarding deforestation and pesticide use. If we truly want sustainable and efficient production of foods, <b>promoting and boosting nature's inherent strenghts while diminishing the damages to the ecosystem</b>
      should be the key elements of study and research. For anyone interested in a practical solution to the problem of bees dying because of the increased pathogens they encounter,
      <a href="https://fungi.com/pages/bees">Paul Stamets deviced a creative solution</a> to pair mushrooms with bees to upregulate their inmunoligical systems to withstand and defeat many pathogens, thus increasing the
      lifespan of bees.
    </p>
    <figure>
      <a href="/images/posts/Nature/ClimateChange/beefriendly.jpg"><img src="/images/posts/Nature/ClimateChange/beefriendly.jpg" alt="Artist representation of bees and mushrooms."></a>
      <figcaption class="caption-text">A bear leaves a scratch on a tree to comunicate his presence; a mushroom appears in this scar as a consequence; bees get attracted to these mushrooms as a supplement for their inmune system; the bees generate honey nearby; the bear recieves the reward for his act without knowing he initiated this process. <a href="https://fungi.com/blogs/articles/bee-friendly-research-update-3">Image source</a><figcaption>
    </figure>
    <p>
      This should be a clear warning sign for anyone who insists in producing a <b>drastic change</b> in the ecological systems without understanding the consequences, on the grounds that <b>nature always uses the combined efforts
      of different species to generate a dynamic equilibrium</b> beneficial for every species involved, so a radical destruction of a portion of any system can quickly damage and ultimately disrupt current natural ecosystems.
    </p>
    <p>
      This is just a few of the hundreds of baffling examples of how the <b>severing of man from Nature</b> has caused man to take increasingly more savage and desperate ways to impose control over the environment, <b>an environment he doesn't
      understand and claims to be able to control under the guise of preventing "climate change"</b>.
      The increase in droughts is not only becoming a problem in Australia, China has seen an inmense expansion of it's control over water and rivers by building hundreds of dams to encapsulate the water,
      causing <a href="https://greatgameindia.com/how-chinese-dams-are-causing-droughts-in-asia/">severe droughts</a> in many parts of Asia which always depended on the natural flow of water
      through the rivers. A world in which water is increasingly controlled and stopped from its natural flow instead of <b>allowing nature to flow and replenish every river</b> is a world which
      is <b>destined to perish</b>, for as <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viktor_Schauberger">Victor Schauberger</a>, a man who dedicated his entire life to the study of water, used to say:

  <h3 class="color">Conclusion</h3>
  <p>
    As we have seen the science of climate change is of a very recent origin and only serves to monitor nature and to keep expanding our knowledge about the complexities of our climate; the moment we take action based on
    a series of evidences we must make sure we know what the exact consequences will be, for the climate has always been self-regulating and, as stated before, <b>any changes in a multivariate system can
    cause hard to predict results</b> if you dont know all the variables involved. It is for this reason I believe taking political action to suppress the freedoms of populations and making
    them pay a carbon tax for the supposed damage to the atmosphere only serves to expand the reach and power of the ruling class, something which should worry anybody, for <b>the bigger the power of
    the ruling class, the smaller the freedoms and value of the individual in any society</b>. Protecting natural landscapes should be a priority to stop the growing dangers of deforestation and
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monoculture">monocultural farming</a> in favor of a <b>more mindful use of our natural resources and a return to more natural ways of farming in which biodiversity and
    a combination of <a href="https://returntonow.net/2017/12/11/permaculture-future-food/">permaculture farming</a> with fungi can help the flora protect itself against pathogens instead of having to achieve the same effect with pesticides</b>.
  </p>
  <p>
    We have also seen how different solutions can reduce the impact of plastics in our environment such as Boyan Slat's Ocean Cleanup company or Paul Stamet's amazing insights into the ability of mushrooms to eat plastics, petroleum and carbon dioxide.
    My conclusion is therefore that the most viable change we can produce in our environment is to firstly; stop blindly accepting information which you cant or won't take the time necessary to corroborate; secondly, <b>always try to search for
    the truth</b> before you take action or share information with others; and thirdly, once you have <b>changed yourself</b> by striving for truth, <b>change your close environment and close relationships</b> in any way you see possible so maybe we can all grow more
    confident in our evidence about our environment and, in this way, <b>produce a change to our society from the inside out</b>. With regards to our energy consumption, the use of natural gas through fracking will continue to be used in the close
    future but the way forward is through clean technologies, something which will eventually overtake the use of natural gas if the price and efficiency of clean energies keep becoming cheaper through <b>intelligent spending of money in research and
    investgation</b> rather than carbon policies and repression of economic activities. With respect to this last point I would like to clarify that the use of political measures to impose certain limits and taxes to those companies which cause an in crease
    in residues or contamination <a href="https://www.elcato.org/propuestas-liberales-contra-el-cambio-climatico">can be a good solution</a> because every bad action that ultimately damages nature should have direct consequences for those causing the damage, but to allow this measures to become a form of collection of funds from individual
    citizens in order to stop the "carbon dioxide emissions" appears to me as an absurdity as big as collecting taxes for every breath we take.
  </p>
  <p>
    I hope you had a chance to learn something you didn't know before just as I did and as a closure to this article let me share with you an idea of great value and worth pondering about:
  </p>
  <blockquot class='border-left'>
    <p>
      <i>
        An individual act that requieres of courage and bravery, no matter how small, has repercussions beyond the own individual and his closest relationships, for in the same way a wave moves along its medium,
        an act of courage journeys without limit in a world without borders and has the capacity to alter in unimaginable ways anyone who percieves the act.
