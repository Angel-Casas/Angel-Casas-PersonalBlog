      [...] what can be more pleasant or more properly human than to be able to engage in elegant conversation
       and show oneself a stranger to no subject? For the one thing that most especially sets us above animals is
       that we can express our thoughts through speech.[...] I assert that the leadership and wisdom of the perfect
       orator provide the chief basis not only for his own dignity, but also for the safety of countless individuals
       and of the state at large. Therefore, young men, continue your present efforts and devote all your energies
       to the pursuit you are following, so that you can bring honor to yourselves, service to your friends,
       and benefit to the state.

<h4 class="color" id="sub-header-1">Introduction</h4>
<p><span class='drop-cap color left'>A</span> friend of mine since my childhood once told me when we where still teenagers
  something which has stuck with me till this day and I wanted to share it so as to present you with the main idea of this post
  and as an introduction. He said something along this lines:
</p>
<p><i>I trust more a man who has learned from all religions and comes to a conclusion by his own than a man who just stays with the religion fell in love with.</i></p>
<p>It is that curiosity and that search for meaning which is of such importance and sits at the basis of science and understanding.
  This is the main message i want to transmit with this post, holding onto an idea because many people believe in it doesn't make
  it real in any sense and only stops you from inquiring and finding the truth behind it, which is at the core of what science is.
  Having said this I have been studying the facts behind Climate Change for a while since there is a lot of misunderstandings and false claims
  circulating around the "news" recently. Hopefully I can help push some clarity into the minds of those who blindly accept ill-informed
  judgments and try to encourage even just a few into investigating for themselves about this complex and extraordinary world we live in.
</p>
<p>Two important messages I want to transmit by the end of this post: </p>
<p>Science must continue to be the only way forward, which means always challenge any dogmatic assumption in favor of a search for the truth.</p>
<p>Innovation and an increase in the level of wellbeing of the citizens should be priority, for there is enough statistical evidence to show that the more free and capitalist societies have an increased sense of care for the world around them.</p>
<p>Which in return allows for novel ideas to tackle the effects of human made changes in the climate.</p>
<p></p>
<h4 class="color" id="sub-header-2">Key Questions</h4>
<p>These are the three questions I plan to answer by the end of this post, so if you feel they catch your curiosity please stay and
follow me through my thought process and hopefully we can both reach a bit more clarity on this issues.
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Why do people blindly accept information without checking it's real value, which happens to be the leitmotif of many religions?</li>
  <li>Is Climate Change a real issue or simply a fact about an everchanging world?</li>
  <li>Can we produce a change thrugh a political position or is the individual the only valuable component of change?</li>
</ul>

  Religions have a rich and extremely complex set of tools at their disposal to transmit the elements of divinity to it's followers,
  although religions have been the cornerstone of most if not all major civilizations, it is it's dogma that
  is causing it's demise and the unprecedented rejection by an increasing number of population across the globe, especially in western societies,
  in favor of a more
  cientific view of the world. This does not mean we should reject everything about religion and blindly toss it away, we could abandon
  our presuposition that religion has nothing to say about reality and instead start seeing religion through the eyes of science
  and figure out how can religion have been so successful in redirecting and civilizing a world governed by chaos and corruption/entropy.
  During the last decades Climate Change has had an increasing attention of the media and anyone worried with the effects of man-made
  climate change, which is a good sign of an increase in <b>care</b> and <b>attention</b> to a world increasingly influenced by humans.

  The problem begins when people start believing alarming news about the end of the world and the damages caused by an overly capitalistic
  society, instead of looking for the evidence and rejecting false claims. You see, this problem of accepting information at face value means
  any new evidence which contradicts your point of view will cause you to reject it or simply to disregard it. Sounds a bit like religion yet?

<p>Effects of CO2, positive and negative.</p>
<p>Biological lifeforms throughout history have reduced the amount of co2 in the planet and increased the amount of oxygen, allowing more complex lifeforms to benefit from this increasing richness in oxygen.</p>
<p>Carbon is associated with most lifeforms and it's effect in the cycle of life is crucial. This means a big variation in the amount of co2 in the atmosphere can have unpredictable consequences in many lifeforms on earth.</p>
<p>An increase in co2 in the atmosphere increases the absorption by green biomass, but also in the seas and lakes therefor increasing its acidity.</p>
<p>GreenHouse gases elevate the temperature of the earth by preventing solar radiation from leaving earth, which allows to prevent increasingly low temperatures.</p>
