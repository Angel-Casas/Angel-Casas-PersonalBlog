<p><span class='drop-cap color left'>A</span>good friend of mine once told me when we where still teenagers
  something which has stuck with me ever since he said it and I wanted to share it so as to present you with the main idea of this post
  and as an introduction. He said something along this lines:
</p>
<p><i>I trust more a man who has learned from all religions and comes to a conclusion by his own than a man who just stays with the religion he first encountered.</i></p>
<p>It is that curiosity and that search for meaning which is of such importance and sits at the basis of science and understanding.
  This is the main message i want to transmit with this post; holding onto an idea because many people believe in it doesn't make
  it real in any sense and only stops you from inquiring and finding the truth behind it, which is at the core of what science is.
  Having said this I have been studying the facts behind Climate Change for a while since there is a lot of misunderstandings and false claims
  circulating around the "news" recently. Hopefully I can help push some clarity into the minds of those who blindly accept ill-informed
  judgments and try to encourage even just a few into investigating for themselves about this complex and extraordinary world we live in.
</p>
<p>Two important messages I want to transmit by the end of this post: </p>
<ul>
  <li class="numeral">Science must continue to be the only way forward, which means always challenge any dogmatic assumption and <b>never</b> close the door to new evidence which may contradict your hypothesis.</li>
  <li class="numeral">Innovation and an increase in the level of wellbeing of the citizens should be priority, for there is enough statistical evidence to show that the more free and capitalist societies have an increased sense of care for the world around them, which in return allows for novel ideas to tackle the effects of human made changes in the climate.</li>
</ul>
<h4 class="color" id="sub-header-1">Key Questions</h4>
<p>These are the three questions I plan to answer by the end of this post, so if you feel they catch your curiosity please stay and
follow me through my thought process and hopefully we can both reach a bit more clarity on this issues.
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Why do people blindly accept information without checking it's real value, which happens to be the leitmotif of many religions?</li>
  <li>Is Climate Change a real issue or simply a fact about an everchanging world?</li>
  <li>Can we produce a change through a political position or is the individual the only valuable component of change?</li>
</ul>

  Religions have a rich and extremely complex set of tools at their disposal to transmit the elements of divinity to it's followers,
  although religions have been the cornerstone of most if not all major civilizations, it is it's dogma that
  is causing it's demise and the unprecedented rejection by an increasing number of population across the globe, especially in western societies,
  in favor of a more
  cientific view of the world. This does not mean we should reject everything about religion and blindly toss it away, we could abandon
  our presuposition that religion has nothing to say about reality and instead start seeing religion through the eyes of science
  and figure out how can religion have been so successful in redirecting and civilizing a world governed by chaos and corruption, and maybe in this understanding we can regain the knowledge of the divine in everything which is an old idea being brought back
  into the western societies mostly due to the new influence of Eastern mysticism increasingly resonating in the western world (as it's clearly shown in the growing tourism around Eastern societies by western people and by the introduction of  mystical practices into western societies).
  During the last decades Climate Change has had an increasing attention of the media and anyone worried with the effects of man-made
  climate change, which is a good sign of an increase in <b>care</b> and <b>attention</b> to a world increasingly influenced by humans.

  The problem begins when people start believing alarming news about the end of the world and the damages caused by an overly capitalistic
  society, instead of looking for the evidence and rejecting false claims. You see, this problem of accepting information at face value means
  any new evidence which contradicts your point of view will cause you to reject it or simply to disregard it. Sounds a bit like dogmatic religion yet?
  We should remember the enemy of humanity is not any other than dogmatism and we should remember the importance our ancestors gave to questioning authority, for ever since Socrates, the famous Classical Greek Philosopher, taught us the inescapable need to question dogma,
  it is in each individual alone the posibility to break the shackles of imposition in favor of a scientific dissection and deconstruction of arguments and supposed "facts".

<p>
  The most notable example of this dogmatic religion being formed is the new appearance of a messianic figure (One who is regarded as the savior or liberator) Greta Thunberg, praised by the media and acclaimed by easily decieved people of all ages.
  Although many may not be aware, in 1992 there was a similar example of a young girl named Severn Suzuki who spoke in the United Nations. Severn insisted she represented the younger generation
  and how every country had failed the new generations allowing the holes in the Ozone layer to grow out of control. She even talked about how she feared going out on the streets due to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TJICmLMb06Y">the damage the sun rays
  would produce her.</a> This kind of alarmism tries to reach the emotional part of every human being, which makes it difficult to counter the arguments being presented without seeming to be a cold hearted monster. Well, 27 years later the ozone layer has
  <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/science-environment-49714987">been reducing it's size</a> ever since the Montreal Protocol was passed in 1987 (yes, five years before she gave her speech), banning the production and use of the most damaging chemicals.
  By expressing this I dont mean to ridicule or mock her actions in any way, for I believe she pinpointed at a problem which could have had grave implications had it not been carefully attended to, my main issue was the exaggerated news being portrayed in the media which only served to obscure the real problems and facts one should carefully analize.
  This time around Greta tells a different story with a similar intention, that is, to make europeans feel guilty for a supposed ecological catastrophe caused by Capitalism.
  My intentions here by describing her actions are not, as stated earlier with Severn, to discredit her, for I believe more <b>awareness</b> and <b>pinpointing</b> the issues at hand are of great help to further investigate possible solutions.
  What I want to focus your attention to is mostly the fact that an increasing number of people have accepted her message as valid and have never tried to understand the problems we face when trying to understand
  climate change at large. If a problem so complex could be reduced to an univariate dimension we would have solved it as soon as someone pointed it out, as happened with the Ozone and the prohibition of certain chemicals.
</p>
<p>
  If one is to humbly accept the fact that Climate Change has always happend and <b>will continue to happen</b>, we could begin to study the problem by increasing spending in Research and Investigation, rather than imposing sanctions and restrictions which only work to the detriment
  of the whole population. By the way, the European Union represents only 13% of the global CO2 emissions in the world, so if one was to take seriously the message pushed by Greta then the message would have more impact on China or India since they produce more than 35% of the global emissions and have had a major increase in emissions,
  mostly due to the fact they have opened their economies to a more global market and embraced certain capitalist principles to push it's citizens into the middle class.
  I will bring useful information and clear data later in the post but for now I wanted to make clear that in order for anyone to have a more clear knowledge about the effects of Climate Change they must first stop accepting any fatalistic or dramatic declarations about the end of the world
  and begin by humbly looking for the evidence which is more often that not ommitted by most media outlets.

  <figcaption>Boyan Slat and his revolutionary system to clean up the oceans from surface plastics</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>I wonder why so many people blindly follow a girl who's message oversimplifies a very complex problem, but almost nobody has heard about the invention a young teenager created to clear most of the plastics which are piling up on the surface of our oceans.
  If you have never heard of <a href="https://theoceancleanup.com/">Boyan Slat and the Ocean Cleanup</a> then maybe it's time you stop trusting in the same media which have pushed the idea of a young girl being an important element of the fight against Global Warming and maybe you should start doing your own research.
  Boyan and his team came up with a bold plan to clean up more than 90% of the plastic in the ocean when he was just a teenager, and in just 7 years has reached many milestones in his journey.
  More recently his team has developed a system called <a href="https://theoceancleanup.com/rivers/">The Interceptor</a> to catch all the plastic they can in the rivers before it reaches the ocean.
  This is a non-profit organization, which means every revenue they get will be returned to the company in order to keep improving and building better systems of cleaning.
  This project is having and will continue to have a staggering impact in the health of the environment and should make anyone rejoice and smile at such a feat of a young boy's imagination.
  This is just one example of what patience and discipline joined with a creative mind can bring forth into the betterment of our society and environment at large.
  I wanted to focus in the fact that it is a <b>non-profit organization</b> to show how you dont have to be an activist or an environmantalist to make a profound impact on our planet.
  The <a href="https://theoceancleanup.com/milestones/how-it-all-began/">story of Boyan Slat</a> should serve as an example of how an emerging problem can bring about the attention of entrepreneurs to find the means and the investments necessary to unfold their plans to eliminate such a problem, and the story of Boyan is truly and inspiring one.
  Now, having talked about this quasi-religious and dogmatic view of Global Warming and its counterpart, a more rational approach to a problem as in the case of Boyan Slat. I would like to present some information and facts about it's effect on the planet.
  In order to make this post more valuable I will like to briefly introduce the Scientific method so each one of us can analize the data we are being presented anywhere and try and understand it's usefulness.
</p>
<p>What defines a scam? First a promise of great returns. Second a sense of urgency or you will be left out. Third a sense of Ultimatum you dont want to miss.</p>
<h3 class="color" id="header-3">A light in the dark</h3>
<p>The Scientific Method, which is a method by which science is carried out, involves building hypothesis based on previous observations about a phenomenon (induction), the study of the implications of this hypothesis (deduction)and the experimental testing of this hypothesis which must be verifiable and repeatable/replicable
 by anyone. This method allows for predictions to appear as a consequence of studying a subject and the successive discarding of erroneus or invalid information.
 It is this predictions which can then be tested for it's ability to explain the phenomenon studied. If we can successfully predict an event from a given initial hypothesis through experiment we say we have a new scientific truth. Having cleared this concept out we must remember the science of climate change is
 of a very recent origin and the modern collection of data with respect to global temperatures only dates from as late as the 1880's, although there are many accurate temperature recordings since the invention of the modern thermometer in the early 1700s which <a href="https://qz.com/1055629/why-does-all-our-climate-data-start-in-1880/">have not been digitalized</a>.
 Thus, whenever you hear we have broken a new temperature record remember, this is true only with respect to the last 100 years of available modern data, since monitoring global surface temperatures was not an easy feat until modern times.

<p>Effects of CO2, positive and negative.</p>
<p>Biological lifeforms throughout history have reduced the amount of co2 in the planet and increased the amount of oxygen, allowing more complex lifeforms to benefit from this increasing richness in oxygen.</p>
<p>Carbon is associated with most lifeforms and it's effect in the cycle of life is crucial. This means a big variation in the amount of co2 in the atmosphere can have unpredictable consequences in many lifeforms on earth.</p>
<p>An increase in co2 in the atmosphere increases the absorption by green biomass, but also in the seas and lakes therefor increasing its acidity.</p>
<p>GreenHouse gases elevate the temperature of the earth by preventing solar radiation from leaving earth, which allows to prevent increasingly low temperatures.</p>
