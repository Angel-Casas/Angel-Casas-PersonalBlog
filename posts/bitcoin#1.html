<p><span class="drop-cap color left">B</span>itcoin is a new technological innovation providing a solution to a very old problem of how to
  transact something of value between two or more entities in private and with a mutually trusted means of exchange. Money,
  which has been a central part of our civilization and of our ability to interact with each other, is now becoming fully digitalized
  into the internet space. Everytime there has been a new form of transfering value available to broader and broader populations
  it has ushered in a new era of technological inoovations and an increase in prosperity of it's users. With Bitcoin we are seeing this same
  revolution happening again, but with this revolution we are being handed a technology which has a global scope we have never seen before.
  Lets think about some of the implications of this:
  <ul>
    <li>With a global audience you can now <strong>transfer value</strong> between <strong>any number of people anywhere in the world</strong>.</li>
    <li>Permission is not needed from a third party to allow a transaction to take place, only the <strong>approval of both entities involved</strong>.</li>
    <li>Your money can now be <strong>safely stored</strong> and <strong>accesed from anywhere in the world</strong>,which stops the risks from moving money across borders.</li>
    <li>A completely <strong>deflationary commodity</strong> with a <strong>fixed number of units in existance</strong> is for the first time in our history a <strong>truly</strong> scarce commodity.</li>
  </ul>
</p>
<p>The full implications of this will only be clear in the future and for now our most important oportunity is to bring awareness and improvements into
  the Bitcoin ecosystem to allow everyone with a growing interest to understand and to have easy access to such a technological revolution.
  Before closing this post I want to provide a key set of ideas to keep in mind always when working and trying to understand this technology. <a href="https://aantonop.com/" class='color'>Andreas Antonopoulos</a>,
  a very prominent speaker in the Bitcoin space, has been very precise about this key ideas and serves as a great synthesis to what we will be covering in future posts:
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Open</strong>: Available to anyone.</li>
    <li><strong>Borderless</strong>: Accessible from anywhere.</li>
    <li><strong>Decentralized</strong>: No single point of power concentration which can be exploited.</li>
    <li><strong>Censorship-resistant</strong>: Inaccesible to any form of control or suppression.</li>
    <li><strong>Neutral</strong>: Provides a useful service without any implications in political or moral landscapes.</li>
  </ul>
</p>
<p>As a closure to this first post I want to bring into your attention a detail about the original inventor of Bitcoin.
   Satoshi Nakamoto is a pseudonym of the mind (or group of minds) behind the initial development of Bitcoin in 2009 and, to this date, remain anonymous and will probably remain that way for the forseeable future.
   In my next post titled "Bitcoin - The road ahead" I will be going into a little more detail about how Bitcoin was concieved and its evolution during this ten years. Remember, any new technological innovation requires
   some initial time to be devoted towards understanding it so allow yourself to be puzzled by this amazing development without loosing track of its main usefulness which, in this global landscape of central banks and cyclical debt spiral,
   is to free every individual from the devaluation of their savings by central banks controling money printing through <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantitative_easing">Quantitative Easing</a>.

 <p>Please comment any suggestions or improvements I may have been unaware of and lets improve our understanding together!</p>
