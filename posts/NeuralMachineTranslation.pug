  | rtificial intelligence has seen a rise in popularity over the past few years due to the development
  | of new architectures and increased availability of data.
p It is my intent to begin a series of posts describing some of the biggest achievements of machine learning
  | algorithms with the help of some famous examples.
p This are the work of a machine learning student with the strong intention and risk of entering the A.I. field.
  | Bein this my own subjective experience in the field mistakes are assured. So, in an attempt to learn from
  |  my mistakes it is my wish, for anyone who can comment about my posts, to point out this flaws or simply to give 
  | further information or personal thoughts.

p Two great minds of the 19-20th Century, both were incredible mathematicians and presented the bases of Computer Science
  |  and programmable machines. They both produced the very first algorithms to be used by machines setting a milestone in
  |  the development of programable machines. When I first learned about them I was blown away by the precision and clear understanding
  |  they had about algorithms and coding knowledge into a machine.
p Alan Turing famously proposed what was later to be called as a universal Turing Machine, meaning a machine capable of working on one task
  |  but with the capacity to change  its programming to work on a wide range of tasks(Theoretically any task which can be
  |  done by a human using pen and paper). I recommend reading The Essential Turing to have a clear understanding of his ideas for
  |  those of you who also love Artificial Intelligence.

p In my next post I will continue to go deeper into the  history of Machine Learning before moving on to some excellent projects
  |  relevant on our times.
  | Participation and ideas to expand this series of posts are welcomed and greatly appreciated.
p Work in Progress.
